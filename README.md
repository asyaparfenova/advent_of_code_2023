In this repository, I am posting solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Structure of the repository:
- each folder named dayN contains multiple testN.txt, input.txt and solution.py
- testN.txt is/are example(s) given in the task description that has a correct answer in the text of the task;
- input.txt is my competition's input;
- solution.py is a Python file that includes function reading input, parsing it and producing a solution;
- to test code run solution.py with test file name as an argument - e.g. `python solution.py test01`, to produce prod solution - without arguments - e.g. `python solution.py`.
